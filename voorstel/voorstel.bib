The intent of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of various virtual keyboard implementations employing key-resizing strategies on an Android mobile phone. Study participants were asked to type various phrases using three different virtual keyboard implementations in both portrait and landscape orientations. Quantitative results were reported and conclusions were derived to aid in the development and implementation of more efficient virtual keyboard interfaces for mobile devices.},

Currently, most of the models in production are running remotely on servers — for example at Google for search. Still, the improvement of hardware on mobile devices and the increasing focus on privacy make them more and more suitable to run offline.

The goal of this article is to give a high-level view of the development of an Android application for text generation running entirely on-device. The code is available here: https://github.com/huggingface/tflite-android-transformers/tree/master/gpt2},
